# Shopify App Template â€“ Theme Extension Only

This is a template for building a [Shopify app that uses only app extensions](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/app-extensions/build-extension-only-app). It contains everything needed to manage a **theme app extension** without requiring a backend or embedded admin UI.

If you want an app with a full admin interface or embedded pages, consider using the [Remix app template](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix) instead.
